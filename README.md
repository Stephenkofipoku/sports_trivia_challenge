### Accessibility
The website is made accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:
- Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
- Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
- Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments. I employed the contrast checker provided by colormind to validate the contrast ratio between the selected foreground color and background color.

By implementing the above measures the overall accessibiity of the website is improved.
